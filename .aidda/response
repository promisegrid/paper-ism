- The paper introduces a decentralized infinite state machine model compatible with Semantic Spacetime and Promise Theory.
- The system executes a world line discovery process for decentralized decision-making.
- Each agent manages its local state and interacts with others by making promises about state transitions on timelines.
- The model is applicable to general-purpose computing and organizational governance, including decentralized consensus formation.
- Large language models can analyze and propose merges for non-numerical consensus problems, improving upon traditional numerical methods.
- The proposed system can handle both numerical and non-numerical consensus merge problems at a global scale.
- The model integrates principles from computing theory, Infrastructure as Code, Promise Theory, Semantic Spacetime, DevOps, version control, and large language models.
